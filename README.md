Slides, code and data for a tutorial on Analyzing Experiments Using Causal Forests, which I created for R Ladies Philly. 

**If you want to follow along**, you can open the slides [slides](https://eleafeit.github.io/Causal_Forests_Tutorial/Causal_Forests_Tutorial.html). The slides include most of the code, but I may move a bit too fast for you to type the code yourself as I am presenting. 

**If you want to run the code yourself**, you can download the [R Markdown Code for Slides](https://eleafeit.github.io/Causal_Forests_Tutorial/Causal_Forests_Tutorial.Rmd) and open it in R Studio. You will also need to put the [Rhea Chicks Experiment Data](https://eleafeit.github.io//Causal_Forests_Tutorial/rhea.tables.grams.20150626.csv) in the same folder as the R Markdown Code. You can also access the [repo from GitHub](https://github.com/eleafeit/Causal_Forests_Tutorial), if that is how you roll. 

Special thanks to [Sue McDonnell](https://www.vet.upenn.edu/people/faculty-clinician-search/SUEMCDONNELL) for sharing the Rhea Chicks Experiment data reported in [Koch, Colleen S., et al. "Training Rhea americana chicks to walk voluntarily across a scale; effect on the handler's time and the chicks' weight gain compared with traditional techniques: A pilot study." *Journal of Veterinary Behavior* 18 (2017): 69-75](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2016.12.008).
